Got it Sathya 👍
I see what you mean — the formatting in your current README has extra/unclosed backticks and spacing issues. I’ll fix all of that and give you a **clean, copy-paste ready `README.md`**.

Here’s the corrected version:

# 🌌 Astronomy ML Project — Hybrid Machine Learning Solutions

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a **Hybrid Machine Learning & Deep Learning Project** built for **Astronomy image classification and analysis**.  
The project leverages **multiple learning paradigms** — **Supervised, Unsupervised, Semi-Supervised, and Reinforcement Learning** — to analyze and classify galaxies and other astronomical objects.

✅ Now the Markdown is **perfectly formatted** — all code fences are closed, line breaks render properly, and it’s GitHub-ready.  

Do you also want me to include a **repo name suggestion** right at the top of the README (like a subtitle under the title)?
